# CSDI: A Fine-Grained Fundus Image Dataset of Cataract Severity and Diagnostic Images

The **CSDI Cataract Diagnosis Dataset** is a curated collection of 187 fundus images with expert annotations, including cataract severity scores and bilingual diagnostic descriptions (Chinese and English). This dataset supports research in automated cataract screening, grading, and fundus image interpretation using both image and text modalities.

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

- **Total images**: 187
- **Image formats**: `.png` and `.jpg`
- **Annotation file**: `CSDI_diagnosis.csv`
- **Labels**: Cataract severity score (0‚Äì10), optic disc localization, optic disc clarity, expert-written diagnoses

## üóíÔ∏è CSV Annotation File (`CSDI_diagnosis.csv`)
- The CSV annotation file is encoded in **UTF-8** to ensure proper display of Chinese and English characters.

| Column Name                | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| `id`                      | Image file name (e.g., `cataract_001.png`) |
| `score`                   | Cataract severity score (range 0‚Äì10) |
| `Chinese_diagnosis`      | Diagnosis in Chinese |
| `English_diagnosis`      | Diagnosis in English |
| `optic_x`, `optic_y`     | **Top-left corner** of the optic disc bounding box if `optic_disc_clear` is `clear`, or of the entire fundus region if `optic_disc_clear` is `blurry`. The coordinates are expressed as a percentage of image width/height (range 0‚Äì100). |
| `optic_width`, `optic_height` | Width and height of the optic disc bounding box (if `optic_disc_clear` is `clear`) or the entire visible region (if `blurry`), expressed as a percentage of image width/height. |
| `optic_disc_clear`       | Optic disc visibility (`clear` / `blurry`) |
| `image_width`, `image_height` | Actual image resolution in pixels |

> The `score` field supports both **regression** (exact score prediction) and **classification** (e.g., mild/moderate/severe).

## üìä Suggested Severity Levels

The cataract severity grading criteria are defined as follows, with decimal scores (to one decimal place) allowing for precise assessment within each range:

| Severity Level   | Score Range | Quantity | Percentage (%) |
|------------------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Normal           | [0, 1)      | 9        | 4.81           |
| Mild             | [1, 3)      | 30       | 16.04          |
| Moderate         | [3, 5)      | 39       | 20.86          |
| Bad/Advanced     | [5, 7)      | 48       | 25.67          |
| Severe           | [7, 10]     | 61       | 32.62          |

- **0‚Äì1 (Normal):** No cataract; fundus images are clear with no lens opacity affecting image quality.  
- **1‚Äì3 (Mild):** Mild cataract; images remain clear with subtle blurring, low likelihood of visual impairment.  
- **3‚Äì5 (Moderate):** Moderate cataract; image clarity decreases, regular visual monitoring recommended, surgery unlikely immediately necessary.  
- **5‚Äì7 (Bad/Advanced):** Noticeable reduction in image clarity, higher probability of visual impairment, elective surgery may be considered.  
- **7‚Äì10 (Severe):** Marked reduction in image clarity, significant impact on visual function, prompt surgical intervention advised.

## üîç Diagnostic Content

Each record contains detailed diagnostic descriptions in both Chinese and English, following a fixed sentence structure evaluating:

- **Overall Color:** Typical orange-red fundus background; deviation toward yellow-white indicates increased cataract severity.  
- **Optic Disc and Vessel Clarity:** Blurring of optic disc margins and reduced vessel clarity indicate lens opacity affecting image quality.  
- **Macular Area:** Accurate localization and assessment of the macula is crucial; inability to do so suggests advanced cataract.  
- **Retinal Vessel Clarity and Branching:** Severity increases as visualization decreases from fine branch vessels, to major vessels and second-order branches, to only major vessels visible, to complete inability to distinguish vascular structures.  

This standardized scoring system and diagnostic protocol were strictly adhered to by annotators to ensure high-quality, reliable annotations.

Chinese and English versions of the diagnostic descriptions are included to support multilingual and cross-lingual research applications.
